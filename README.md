__Purpose:__ This is a private repo for Comp 20 Web Programing created by Ming Chow and populated by Ayal Pierce

__Favorite Lab/Assignment__ My favorite Lab/Assignment was Assignment 3, the real Marauder's Map, since I learned the most from that assignment (i.e. backend stuff).

__Growth__: I have definitely grown a lot. The only Web Programming I knew was bbasic front end and Web Security but did not know how front end and backend communicate. I am definitely glad I took this class before I graduated.

__Most Important Thing I learned:__ Not to reinvent the wheel. Looking at my first web page, which was built from scratch, one can see how a basic web page can be built. But why not use Bootstrap or Gumby for a front end framework? Furthermore, APIs are extremely useful. Why reinvent a database for food when you can use Yelp's API or Google's API??

__Future Delving__ My interest lies in Web Security, however since I am persuing Medicine, I would be interested in doing Web Development in the medical field.

Note that assignment 1 and labs 1-3 are not in this repo.
