###Lab 7 for Tufts University Comp 20 - Web Programming

__Implementation-success__ All aspects of the work have been implemented correctly. In *index.html*, the html itself was not touched, and only script was added. When the page loads, entries from local storage are loaded, and when a new entry is enterred, it is added to local storage. Jquery was used. 

__Collaboration:__ I did not collaborate with anyone except for the lab handout and stack overflow

__Time to Complete__: 1 hour
