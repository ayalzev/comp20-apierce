###Lab 6 for Tufts University Comp 20 - Web Programming

__Implementation-success__ All aspects of the work have been implemented correctly. The only files that were altered were *styles.css* and *lab.js*. 

__Collaboration:__ I did not collaborate with anyone, but i used the thinks provided in the lab guide and used class notes to complete the assignment.

__Time to Complete__: 1 hour

__Important Question__: When the lab.js file was altered (in Part 2) to attempt and access a JSON file in a different domain, it did not work. The javascript console threw an error that the XMLHTTPrequest cannot load. No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present on requested source. This is likely a security implementation so that one website (i.e. facebook) cannot access another websites JSON information (like your bank).
Therefore, it seems impossible to request data from a different origin, but in security we will learn that nothing is impossible. It is simple a safeguard.
