#Responsive Design

###Lab 4 for Tufts University Comp 20 - Web Programming.

__Implementation Success__ The programmer believes that all aspects of the work have been implemented correctly. The provided index.html file was not altered and the software.png was not broken down into separate images. Furthermore, only one CSS file was used to complete the lab.

__Collaboration:__ I did not collaborate with anyone. I used the links *Media Queries for Standard Devices* and *How to use CSS sprites* provided by the lab page.

__Time to Complete:__ One Hour
