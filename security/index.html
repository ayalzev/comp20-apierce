		<h1><center>Security Assessment of Marauder's Map</center></h1>
	</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>Pierce Security Solutions (PSS) was hired by Mr. Norman Young to document and
       resolve security and privacy issues in his application. According to his
       client (a Professor Ming Chow), Mr. Young's Marauder's Map is, 
       "a magical document that reveales all of Hogwarts School of Witchraft 
       and Wzardry... and the location of every person in the grounds, portrayed
       by a dot."</p>
	<p> Mr. Youngs product is both the client-side map that sends its location, 
		receives other locations, and displays them all on a server. And the 
		server itself (i.e. POST/GET APIs).</p>
	<p>PSS found numerous vulnerabilities in Mr. Young's application documented below</p> 
</div>
<div class="row">
<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Black Box:</strong> Testing was first carried out using
				"Black-Box" methodology, or what an attacker would be able to 
				attack without seeing the source code. The actual heroku 
				application was attacked with incrementing damage so as to be 
				able to discover further vulnerabilities. The Google Chrome 
                POSTMAN extension and Mozilla Firefox TamperData extension 
				were used as well. Almost all the vulnerabilites were found
				in the Black-Box stage.</li>
			<li><strong>White-Box:</strong> Mr. Young's provided code was then 
				reviewed to find unideal coding practices, server-side 
				exploitations should an attacker gain access, and possible areas
				for vulnerability resolution.</li>
		<ul>
</div>
<div class="row">
<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<p>The most glaring security issues came from Mr. Young trusting user input. 	As Professor Ming Chow at Tufts University states, "Never Trust User Input."
	Mr. Young enables CORS and never sanitizes or limits user input so a user 
	can send large scripts and execute MongoDB database queries. Mr. Young does 
	prevent the vulnerability of submitting malicious data via the latitude and
 	longitude parameters since they are expecting floats. 
	However, the login parameter remains extremely vulnerable.</p>

<div class="row">
<h2>Issues Found</h2>
	<ol>
	<li><strong>Cross Site Scripting - General</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li> <strong>Location:</strong> Injected via POST API in the "login" parameter" and executed when client loads via GET API</li>
		<li> <span class="high">High Severity:</span> 
		With this XSS vulnerability, any amount of malicious code 
		can be executed on the client side from a window relocation to a fake, 
        site, to cookie stealing.</li>
		<li><strong>Description:
			</strong>Found using the Google Chrome POSTMAN extentsion and 
			testing with 
		<code>&ltscript&gtalert("Hacked by ayal 01")&lt/script&gt </code> </li>
		<li><img src="xss.JPG" class="img-thumbnail" alt="xss" width="421px" height="208px"></li>
		<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> This issue can be resolved by escaping
		 characters to their HTML encoding when it is stored in the database. 
		For an example, see Ming Chow's HtmlEncode() 
		<a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/DefenseOfTheDarkArts/irc/irc.js">Here</a>
		</li>
		</ul>
	<li><strong>Cross Site Scripting - DB Injection Local Effects</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li> <strong>Location:</strong> Injected via POST API in the "login" parameter" and executed when client loads via GET API</li>
		<li> <span class="high">Medium-High Severity:</span> 
		With this XSS vulnerability, the client will not be able to access the database on the home page. Luckily, this attack did not affect the actual database. However, an attacker with more experience might have been able to wipe out the database</li>
		<li><strong>Description:
			</strong>Found using the Google Chrome POSTMAN extentsion and 
			testing with 
		<code>&ltscript&gtdb.collection(locations, function(e,c){ collection.remove())};&lt/script&gt </code> </li>
		<li><img src="db-deleted.JPG" class="img-thumbnail" alt="xss" width="421px" height="208px"></li>
		<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> This issue can be resolved by escaping
		 characters to their HTML encoding when it is stored in the database. 
		For an example, see Ming Chow's HtmlEncode() 
		<a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/DefenseOfTheDarkArts/irc/irc.js">Here</a>
		</li>
		</ul>
	<li><strong>Location Spoofing - No User Authetication</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Location:</strong> /sendLocation POST API</li>
		<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium: An attacker can either spoof his location or falsify a different client's location if s/he knows that client's login. This attack does not do anything malicious, per se but the severity increases 	depending on how accurate the map needs to be. For example, if Hogwarts' Professors are tracking their students' location. Harry can say he is in his 
dorm and make Malfoy be in the Forbidden Forrest. Or, if the NSA is tracking
Ming Chow, they now think he checked in in Syria</li>
		<li><strong>Description:</strong> This was found by simply sending false			 information with my login and a different GPS coordinate. 
			For example, I was able to say mchow was in Syria! This could also have been done with a Man-In-The-Middle attack using TamperData to change your geolocation before it got sent to the server</li>
		<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Having some type of user authentication before having the ability to check in information </li>
		</ul>
	</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Overall, Pierce Security Solutions does not recommend deploying this app for public use since it is has security vulnerabilites, such as XSS, that can be dangerous for any client who accessses the data. Furthermore, due to a lack of user authentication, the data provided by Mr. Young's server cannot be trusted as accurate. Fortunately, the XSS vulnerability is easy to solve with escaping characters but the user authetication might take some more ingenuity. For $50/hour, Pierce Security Solutions will fix these glaring vulnerabilities and prepare the server for deployment
